dotfiles
========

This is a very poorly named repo, as it now contains more than just dotfiles. Eventually I'll update this README. Maybe. Possibly.

Requirements
============

## Terminal

* `fish`
* [`oh-my-fish`](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) (optional)
* `git`
* a font with a wide array of icons and symbols; see [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com) to get your favorite font patched with extra symbols.

### Optional

* `which`
* `hostname` (arch users install package `inetutils`)
* [`exa`](https://github.com/ogham/exa)
* [`starship`](https://starship.rs)

## Vim

* [`vundle`](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)

Local Config
===============

OMF allows a custom local configuration file. Use this file for anything that needs to be local only to your current device, or to override some base configuration. Create a file in your homedir called `.fish_local.fish` and put your custom/overrides there.
