dotfiles
========

This is a very poorly named repo, as it now contains more than just dotfiles. Eventually I'll update this README. Maybe. Possibly.

Requirements
============

* `fish`
* `which`
* `hostname` (arch users install package `inetutils`)
* [`exa`](https://github.com/ogham/exa)
* [`starship`](https://starship.rs)

Getting Started
===============

# Install oh-my-fish:

Install omf via the curl listed [here](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish).

## Local Config

OMF allows a custom local configuration file. Use this file for anything that needs to be local only to your current device, or to override some base configuration. Create a file in your homedir called `.fish_local.fish` and put your custom/overrides there.

# TODO
