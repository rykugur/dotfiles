# dotfiles / nixOS config

My personal nixOS config + dotfiles.

The nixOS config is contained within a flake, with home-manager installed as a nixOS module. Most configs are contained within the `./configs` directory, and are symlinked into place by home-manager.

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## TODO

- Figure out why custom snippets are showing up twice
- Get navic working
